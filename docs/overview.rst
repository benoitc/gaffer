Overview
========

Gaffer is a set of Python modules and tools to easily maintain and
interact with your processes.

Depending on your needs you can simply use the gaffer tools (eventually
extend them) or embed the gaffer possibilities in your own apps.

Design
------

Gaffer is internally based on an event loop using the 
`libuv <https://github.com/joyent/libuv/>`_ from Joyent via 
the `pyuv binding <https://pyuv.readthedocs.org>`_

All gaffer events are added to the loop and processes asynchronously which
make it pretty performant for handling & controlling multiple processes.

At the lowest level you will find the manager. A manager is responsible
for maintaining live processes and managing actions on them:

- start/stop processes
- increase/decrease the number of instances of each process, via process templates
- add/remove process templates to manage

A process template describes the way a process will be launched and how
many OS processes you want to handle for this template. This number can
be changed dynamically.

Current properties for each template:

- **name**: name of the process (eg, 'django-server')
- **cmd**: program command, (eg. '/var/www/CMS/manage.py')
- **args**: the arguments for the command to run. Can be a list or
  a string. If **args** is  a string, it's split using
  :func:`shlex.split`. Defaults to None.
- **env**: a mapping containing the environment variables the command
  will run with. Optional
- **uid**: int or str, user id
- **gid**: int or st, user group id,
- **cwd**: working dir
- **detach**: the process is launched but won't be monitored and
  won't exit when the manager is stopped.
- **shell**: boolean, run the script in a shell. (UNIX
  only),
- **os_env**: boolean, pass the os environment to the program
- **numprocesses**: int the number of OS processes to launch for
  this description
- **flapping**: a FlappingInfo instance or, if flapping detection
  should be used. flapping parameters are:

  - **attempts**: maximum number of attempts before we stop the
    process and set it to retry later
  - **window**: period in which we are testing the number of
    retry
  - **retry_in**: seconds, the time after we restart the process
    and try to spawn them
  - **max_retry**: maximum number of retry before we give up
    and stop the process.
- **redirect_output**: list of io to redict (max 2) this is a list of custom
  labels to use for the redirection. Ex: ["a", "b"]Â will
  redirect stdoutt & stderr and stdout events will be labeled "a"
- **redirect_input**: Boolean (False is the default). Set it if
  you want to be able to write to stdin.


The manager is also responsible of starting and stopping gaffer
applications that you add to the manager to react to different events. A applicaton can
fetch information from the manager and interact with it.

Running an application is done like this:


    # initialize the controller with the default loop
    loop = pyuv.Loop.default_loop()
    manager = Manager(loop=loop)

    # start the controller
    manager.start(applications=[HttpHandler()])

    .... # do smth

    manager.stop() # stop the controlller
    manager.run() # run the event loop


The HttpHandler application allows you to interact with gaffer via
HTTP.  It is used by the gafferd server which is able for now to load
process templates via an ini files and maintain an HTTP endpoint which
can be configured to be accessible on multiples interfaces and
transports (tcp & unix sockets) .

.. note::

    Only applications instances are used by the manager. It allows you
    to initialize them with your own settings.

Building your own application is easy, basically an application has the
following structure::


    class MyApplication(object):

        def __init__(self):
            # initialisation

        def start(self, loop, manager):
            # this method is called by the manager to start the controller

        def stop(self):
            # method called when the manager stops

        def restart(self):
            # method called when the manager restarts


You can use this structure for anything you want, (even add an app to the
loop).

To help you in your work a :doc:`pyuv implementation <tornado_pyuv>` of
tornado is integrated and the powerful :doc:`events <events>` module
allows you to manage PUB/SUB events (or anything evented) inside
your app. An EventEmitter is a threadsafe class to manage subscriber and
publisher of events. It is internally used to broadcast process and
manager events.


Watch stats
-----------

Stats of a process can be monitored continuously (there is a refresh
interval of 0.1s to fetch CPU informations) using the following
method::

    manager.monitor(<nameorid>, <listener>)

Where `<nameorid>` is the name of the process template. In this case
the statistics of all the the OS processes using this template will be
emitted. Stats events are collected in the listener callback.

Callback signature: ``callback(evtype, msg)``.

**evtype** is always "STATS" here and **msg** is a dict::

    {
        "mem_info1: int,
        "mem_info2: int,
        "cpu": int,
        "mem": int,
        "ctime": int,
        "pid": int,
        "username": str,
        "nicce": int,
        "cmdline": str,
        "children": [{ stat dict, ... }]
    }

To unmonitor the process in your app run::

    manager.unmonitor(<nameorid>, <listener>)

.. note::

    Internally a monitor subscribe you to an EventEmitter. A timer is
    running until there are subscribers to the process stats events.

Of course you can directly monitor a process using the internal pid::

    process = manager.running[pid]
    process.monitor(<listener>)

    ...

    process.unmonitor(<listener>)

IO Events
---------

Subscribe to stdout/stderr process streams
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can subscribe to stdout/stderr process streams and even write to
stdin if you want.

To be able to receive the stdout/stderr streams in your application,
you need to create a process with the *redirect_output* setting::


    manager.add_process("nameofprocestemplate", cmd,
        redirect_output["stdout", "stderr"])


.. note::

    Name of outputs can be anything, only the order counts. So if you want
    to name *stdout* as *a* just replace *stdout* by *a* in the
    declaration.

    If you don't want to receive *stderr*, just omit it from the list.

    If you want to redirect stderr to stdout just use the same
    name.


Then for example, to monitor the stdout output do::

    process.monitor_io("stdout", somecallback)

Callback signature: ``callback(evtype, msg)``.

And to unmonitor::

    process.unmonitor_io("stdout", somecallback)

.. note::

    To subscribe to all process streams replace the stream name by
    `'.'`` .


Write to STDIN
++++++++++++++

Writing to stdin is pretty easy. Just do::

    process.write("somedata")

or to send multiple lines::

    process.writelines(["line", "line"])

You can write lines from multiple publishers and multiple publishers can
write at the same time. This method is threadsafe.


HTTP API
--------

See the :doc:`HTTP api description <http>` for more informations.

Tools
-----

Gaffer proposes different tools (and more will come soon) to manage your
processes without having to code. It can be used like `supervisor
<http://supervisord.org/>`_, `god <http://godrb.com/>`_, `runit
<http://smarden.org/runit/>`_  or other tools around. Speaking of runit
a similar controlling will be available in 0.2 .

See the :doc:`command-line` documentation for more informations.
